# 4MEngineeringDescription
A Readme File explaining how the site works and what I did to make it run

## Purpose
My client 4MEngineers.com asked me to to develop, test, and deploy a website efficiently while maintaining a clean workflow between local and hosted files.

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JS (vanilla or frameworks)
- GoDaddy (domain and hosting)
- FileZilla (SFTP file transfer)
- XAMPP (local Apache server for testing)
